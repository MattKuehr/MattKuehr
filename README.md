- Probability and Statistics I (STAT 3600)
- Introduction to Proofs (MATH 3100)

**Some more specialized courses**
- Mathematical Modeling (MATH 5000)
- Real Analysis I (MATH 5200)
- Numerical Analysis I (MATH 5630)
- Theory of Nonlinear Optimization (MATH 5650)

**Courses I am taking right now**
- Introduction to Algorithms (COMP 3270)

- Real Analysis II (MATH 5210)
- Numerical Analysis II (MATH 5640)
- Linear Optimization (MATH 5710)

## Research Interests üîé

My research interests are in the intersection of computer science and applied math:

- Applications of neural networks
  - Regression and classification with multi-layer perceptrons.
  - Image classification tasks with convolutional neural networks.
  - Simulation and parameter inversion with physics informed neural networks.
- Numerical computing
  - Gradient free optimization with particle swarm optimization.
  - Using parallel computing to train neural networks.
  - Building computational graphs for automatic differentiation in neural networks.
