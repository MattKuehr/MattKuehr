# Welcome to my GitHub!

## About Me üëã

- My name is Matt Kuehr and I am a Senior at Auburn University studying applied mathematics and artifical intelligence.
- From May to August of 2025, I was a machine learning intern at [Hadrian Automation](https://www.hadrian.co/) in Torrance, California.
- Since January of 2023, I have been involved in a join research lab between the Aerospace and Mathematics departments focusing on applying deep learning to Aerospace domains.
- I am currently and Undergraduate Research Fellow in the math department at Aubrun University, applying numerical optimization to the study of photonic crystals.
- I'm interested in AI and Optimization. Most of my work is in Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Numerical Analysis

## Research Interests üîé

My research interests are in the intersection of computer science and applied math:

- Applications of neural networks
  - Regression and classification with multi-layer perceptrons.
  - Image classification tasks with convolutional neural networks.
  - Simulation and parameter inversion with physics informed neural networks.
- Numerical computing
  - Gradient free optimization with particle swarm optimization.
  - Using parallel computing to train neural networks.
  - Building computational graphs for automatic differentiation in neural networks.
